# Powercord GCP Operations

## Overview

Expert guidance for interacting with the production Powercord server deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The production environment runs in a containerized environment (Container-Optimized OS) where standard development tools (`just`, `poetry`) are omitted for security and performance.

This skill explains how to run operations directly against the deployed container using its isolated virtual environment.

## Quick Reference

### 1. SSH into the Production Instance

To access the host virtual machine:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh powercord-instance --zone us-central1-a
```

### 2. Identify the Container

Once inside the VM, find the running Powercord container ID:

```bash
docker ps
```

### 3. The Golden Rule of Execution

Because the production container lacks `just` and `poetry`, **all Python scripts and modules must be executed using the absolute path to the virtual environment's Python binary**:
`/app/.venv/bin/python`

## Common Operations

### Adding or Managing API Keys

Use the `manage_api_keys.py` script. Note that quotes might be necessary for the arguments.

```bash
# Add a new legacy key
docker exec <CONTAINER_ID> /app/.venv/bin/python app/db/manage_api_keys.py add "LuteBot Legacy Key" --scopes '["midi_library"]' --key "your-hardcoded-key"
```

### Running Background Tasks / Modules

When running modules (e.g., MIDI rescoring), remember that you might need to supply required environment variables if the script expects local port connections rather than Docker networking.

```bash
# Rescore MIDI Library
docker exec -e POWERCORD_DB_HOST=localhost:5432 <CONTAINER_ID> /app/.venv/bin/python -m app.extensions.midi_library.rescore
```

*(Note: `POWERCORD_DB_HOST=localhost:5432` is used because inside the container, the app might connect to the sidecar database container via a different host, or if running directly inside the container without compose networking, the variable override guarantees the correct connection.)*

### Database Backup & Restore

#### Manual Restore Process

1. Upload the dump to the VM:

```bash
gcloud compute scp your_dump_file.sql powercord-instance:~ --zone us-central1-a
```

1. Copy the file from the VM into the container:

```bash
docker cp your_dump_file.sql <CONTAINER_ID>:/app/your_dump_file.sql
```

1. Run the import script using the virtual environment python:

```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /app/.venv/bin/python app/db/db_tools.py import /app/your_dump_file.sql
```

1. Clean up the dump files when complete.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module Not Found Errors**: If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`, double-check that you are using `/app/.venv/bin/python` and not the system `python` or `python3` command.
- **Database Connection Errors**: If a script fails to connect to the database, verify that you have provided the necessary environment overrides (e.g., `-e POWERCORD_DB_HOST=localhost:5432`).
- **GCS Permission Errors**: Ensure the Compute Engine service account (`powercord-compute-sa`) has the required IAM roles (e.g., Storage Object Viewer or `storage.buckets.get` permission) to interact with Google Cloud Storage.
